tattooed and pierced and loin- clothed the mov ie is essentially one long chase se quence as happy hunter gets<br><br><br>pursued by ferocious warriors through rain forests up pyramidal temples down precipitous water falls En route brace yourself for Gibsonian gore-fest of bludgeon ing spearing stabbing throat-slit- ting raping pillaging all unfolding with pulse-pounding intensity Technically this is Gibson's best di recting effort by far Otherwise Apocalypto is a-lotta-woe-to-sit- through with not much to think beyond the teensy matter of sur vival the Mayans' and if you re even remotely squeamish your own 18A Dec 8) Babel Taking its title from the Biblical account of man being condemned to miscommunication Babel directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and screenplay partner Guillermo Arriaga explores unex pected links of grief between dis parate characters darting back and forth in time from Morocco to California Mexico to Tokyo and embracing the big contempor ary themes of terrorism illegal immigration and generational conflict in the stories of four fami lies Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett maybe the stars but most of the dramatic heavy lifting is left to the two women who carry the stories from Mexico beloved family nanny turns into fugitive alien after an ill-advised border cross ing and Japan an angry deaf teenaged girl rages against her fa ther and her mother s death Con sistent with its theme of munication Babel may not know exactly what it wants to say but with its intricate script rich sound track and restless camera it finds fascinating way of almost saying it 14A Nov 3) Children of Men Instantly up to speed and powered by that rarest of cinematic fuels intelligent action Children of Men is nativity story for the ages The setting is London in near- fu ture that bears an unnerving re semblance to the present save for the discomfiting fact that human kind has become infertile premise that sneaks up on us with eerie stealth allowed to grow orga in casual asides and periph eral imagery As it does director Al fonso Cuaron gives conventional genre many unconventional twists and the effects are unique This is dystopian tale with the protective distance removed with tomorrow simultaneously hinged to today and rooted in yesterday It's also an action film that spurns the usual blizzard of edits for single long gorgeously fluid takes Finally it s sci-fi flick that looks and sounds like documentary report filed from London that could be the streets of Baghdad Or the ghetto in<br><br><br>Warsaw Or yes manger in Naza reth 14A Dec 22) Dreamgirls Director Bill Condon's Kinsey adaptation of the 25 -year- old Broadway hit uses historical montages sung dialogue and real istic and stage-bound settings for one of the most innovative and accomplished movie musicals in years The story of the rise of Motown and black pop music is told against the historical back drop of the sixties focusing on the success of Sup remes -like girl trio Jamie Foxx plays the Berry Gordy-like impresario who discov ers girl trio and hires hires them to sing back-up to rough and randy shouter James Thunder Early wonderfully rejuvenated Eddie Murphy Beyonce Knowles is well cast as the Diana Ross-like cross-over star but the musical really belongs to newcomer Jenni fer Hudson the Dreamgirl who was left behind with her scarily<br><br><br>intense performance of the hit AndlAm Telling You I'm Not Going PG Dec 22)-- The Good German V2 Here's what s good about Steven Soderbergh's The Good German- The look is fantastic technically<br><br><br>the movie is retro marvel Here's what s bad The script sucks set in post-war Berlin with George Cloo- ney in Bogie-type role and Cate Blanchett as his Ingrid Bergman it keeps promising to be clever en gaging subtle and utterly fails to deliver And here s what s iffy The conceit is dubious the whole idea of replicating forties noir flick not just the black-and-white stock but right down to the filmmaking techniques and the melodramatic score and even the theatrical style of acting Sincere homage is one thing slavish imitation is quite an other 14A Dec 15) The Good Shepherd Where's 007 when you need him Neither shaken nor stirred The Good Shepherd is flat draft of his tory that looks at the CIA's early years through the horn-rimmed gaze of fictional spook Matt Da mon Since the years in question stretch from the Second World War to the Bay of Pigs invasion one might be excused for anticipating picture charged with incident In stead as directed by Robert De Ni- ro it s not only listless affair but unforgivably given the subject matter isn't even sure of its politi cal footing Too bland to provoke too earnest to entertain too anon to be noticed the movie takes page out of the agent s handbook and fades right into the wallpaper 14 Dec 22) The History Boys Wisely this adaptation of the Alan Bennett play keeps the theat rical cast intact and makes only minimal gestures towards open ing up the piece Instead as bright prep-school lads vie with their vul nerable teachers in that impossibly<br><br><br>articulate Brit-wit style the whole thing is allowed to run on the high-octane of its clever dialogue Yes it s chatty it s wordy but pas sion for the well-written word lies at the thematic heart of the play and cinematic flourishes would only clog the arteries So purists can rest assured the theatre comes unapologetically to the movies and gives us good reason to enroll in The History Boys 14A Nov 24) Night at the Museum Ben Stiller gets his groove back in this loosely improvised likeable comedy the story of museum night-watchman who turns into reluctant zookeeper when the figures under his command come alive The film is yet another CGI miracle Still the most memorable scenes involve monkey with the comic timing of Harpo Marx Almost as funny are star Stiller's improvised sequences with three generations of scene-stealers list that includes Mickey Rooney Dick Van Dyke Robin Williams blessedly restrained Owen Wilson and The Office's Ricky Gervais The rare holiday toy that doesn't require batteries PG Dec 22 --S Notes on Scandal In Zoe Heller's novel Sheba the art teacher dishes up the scandal and Barbara her acid-tongued col league provides the notes her thoroughly unreliable narration gives the book caustic interior voice and us good reason for reading it Obviously that inner voice must disappear in the movie adaptation So we re left with the weakest part of the novel the lurching and often melodramatic<br><br><br>plot plus the chance to see two splendid actors Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett do the best they can with what they re given sadly in Blanchett's case not much Okay no one would call that trade off scandal but it sure ain't much of bargain 14A Dec 23) Pan's Labyrinth Mexican director Guillermo del Toro is best known for his comic book adaptations Blade 3, Hell- boy This fascinatingly dark blend of fantasy horror and history may be his masterpiece Set in Spain following the Civil War the film follows an adolescent girl Ofil who is taken to live in the country with her sickly pregnant mother and sadistic stepfather captain in Franco's army While the captain wages war on the guerilla rem nants of the Republican Army Ofil finds maze in the woods where she meets faun The movie moves seamlessly between the fan tastic and historical worlds and the nightmare both within and without 14A Dec 22) The Queen Helen Mirren is able to do in The Queen what the Queen has never been able or willing to do for her self Mirren humanizes our Liz managing to find beneath the heavy crown and the wrought-iron perm and the leaden bifocals liv ing breathing tough vulnerable and ultimately sympathetic wom an That's quite coup but it isn't the only achievement of Stephen Frears's engaging picture Succeed ing where most docudramas fail it turns slice of recent history the effect of the death of Diana Prin cess of Wales on the behaviour of the Royal family into reveal ingly intelligent entertainment neither didactic nor sentimental There's wit here but the comedy is never cruel and there s compas sion but the emotion is never maudlin Oct 13) Volver As down-to-earth as ghost story gets Pedro Almodovar's Volver is essentially tale of sisterhood told with playful affection and led by dazzling Penelope Cruz as the Earth-mother figure suffer er and survivor Sophia Loren with smaller derriere but bigger smile The title translates as com ing back and what Almodovar keeps coming back to is not the suffering of women but their tran solidarity in the face of that suffering So the movie tilts towards the comic surface of things yet it s surface that never feels superficial Instead Volver is much like the full-bodied ghost at the centre of the plot it s all about the bearable lightness of be ing eternally weighed down 14A Nov 24)<br><br><br>Clive Owen and Julianne Moore in the dystopian tale Children

misrepresenting the position of the Government in the hope of making political capital Mr MoLean stated that he had voted against the Royal Commission proposed by Mr Hender son in committee because it was prac tically motion of want of con fidence in the Government and he had every confidence in the Govern ment of Sir Wilfrid Laurier Besides the Provincial Government was in vestigating at the time and bringing the offenders to in the courts He then went on to show that the Finance Minister could have taken no other action than he did in the issuing the certificate to the Farmers Bank He dearly

Mr Fowler's address was chiefly devoted to reciprocity in which he dealt with the disloyalty cry but he first took occasion to say that he never remembered such enthusiasm as had been shown at recent
